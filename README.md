# LabbookDB

This package contains a relational database structure for life science research, and a number of functions to conveniently add and retrieve information - and generate summaries.
The core concept of LabbookDB is that most of the information classically tracked in a lab book can be more efficiently and more reliably be stored in a relational database.

In comparison to a paper notebook, a database of experimental metadata is:
* More easily stored
* More easily shared
* More easily backed up

Even in comparison with other electronic formats based on a document concept, a database of experimental metadata is:
* More easily browsed
* More easily integrated into data analysis functions
