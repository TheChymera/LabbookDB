	Return a `pandas.DataFrame` object containing only `Cage_Treatment*` entries which are concurrent with the animal stay in the cage to which they were administered.

	Parameters
	----------

	df : pandas.DataFrame
		Pandas Dataframe, with columns containing:
			`Animal_id`,
			`Animal_death_date`,
			`CageStay_start_date`,
			`Cage_Treatment_start_date`,
			`Cage_TreatmentProtocol_code`.
	cagestays : pandas.DataFrame
		Pandas Dataframe, with columns containing:
			`Animal_id`,
			`CageStay_end_date`,
			`CageStay_start_date`,

	Notes
	-----

	This function checks whether cage-level treatment onsets indeed happened during the period in which the animal was housed in the cage.
	We do not check for the treatment end dates, as an animal which has received a partial treatment has received a treatment.
	Checks for treatment discontinuation due to e.g. death should be performed elsewhere.

	Parameters
	----------
	df : pandas.DataFrame
		A `pandas.DataFrame` object containing a long-form `AnimalExternalIdentifier_identifier` column and a dedicated `AnimalExternalIdentifier_database` column.

		The name of a column from `df`, the values of which you want to render unique.

		A dictionary the keys of which are columns you want to collapse, and the values of which are lambda functions instructing how to collapse (e.g. concatenate) the values.
