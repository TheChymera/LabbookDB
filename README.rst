LabbookDB
=========

This package contains a relational database structure for life science research, and a number of functions to conveniently add and retrieve information - and generate summaries.
The core concept of LabbookDB is that most of the information classically tracked in a lab book can be more efficiently and more reliably stored in a relational database.

In comparison to a paper notebook, an **electronic** lab book is:

* More easily stored
* More easily shared
* More easily backed up

In comparison with other electronic formats based on a document concept, a **database** of experimental metadata is:

* More easily browsed
* More easily queried
* More easily integrated into data analysis functions
